## Course Description
R is a freely available statistical package that has grown in popularity. This course exposes students who are familiar
with R the tools to carry of some of the more common inferential statistical procedures. The tenets of hypothesis
testing as well as correlation and simple linear regression are covered. The course is easily accessible to those
without a strong mathematical or statistical background.

## Content

We will cover the following topics:


- Estimation Procedures
- Hypothesis Testing
- Correlation
- Analysis of Variance
- Simple Linear Regression


## Learning Objectives
At the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Choose an appropriate technique based on the research question and data collected by the researcher.
- Interpret the output from R for some advanced statistical methods available in R.
